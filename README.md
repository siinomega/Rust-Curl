# üï∏Ô∏è Rust-Curl

**Rust-Curl** is a lightweight HTTP client built in Rust, inspired by `curl`, allowing users to send HTTP requests to URLs, manage headers, handle data, and save responses to files.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Features

- **Custom User-Agent:** Define a custom `User-Agent` header for requests.
- **Request Method Selection:** Specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- **Data Inclusion:** Include data in the request body, ideal for POST requests.
- **HTTP Version Control:** Set the HTTP version to 1.1 or 2.0.
- **Response Saving:** Save the response content to a file for easy retrieval.
- **Color-Coded Output:** Provides clear messages and errors using color-coded feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running Rust-Curl, ensure you have:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (version 1.67+)
